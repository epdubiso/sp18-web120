 <p>My name is Eden and I am originally from Ethiopia, I moved to America few years ago and made it my new home. As I moved and embarked in to new adventures, I found new passions, and one of those passions was found in information technology/ programming language, focusing more on database and web development.</p>
 <p>I want to graduate from Seattle Central College, and then go to four year University. but, in between I want to do some internships or jobs so I can gain some experience before I go for four-year University.I am so intersted in working so hard for everything I get and earnning the outcome of it.So, I like to do as much schoolwork as possible when I am at school, and when I am not at school or work, I love to spend as much time as possible with my adorable son. I love to read and a connect with different minds and cultures through reading books.</p>
